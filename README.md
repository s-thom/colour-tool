# Colour Tool

## [https://colour.sthom.kiwi](https://colour.sthom.kiwi)

A WIP site to work with colours.

Hopefully doing this will help me with picking colours for things. So far it's been an interesting look into the world of colour and colour spaces.

## TODO

* [x] Add support for different pages
* [x] Put something in the URL when the colour changes?
* [ ] Colour ramps (Helix)
* [ ] Colour ramps (Lab)
* [x] PWA-ification
* [ ] PWA-ification 2 (alert when new version available)
